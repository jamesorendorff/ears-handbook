## Introduction

Welcome to the EARS book.

EARS is a *role-playing game*.
It's not about pieces, moves, winning, and losing;
it's more like a story that you create as you play.
Each player plays the role of one *character* in the story,
the story's heroes.
One player is the *gamemaster*, or *GM*,
responsible for setting the scene,
inventing villains and dilemmas for the heroes to overcome,
narrating the action,
and sorting out what happens when the heroes try something bold and risky.

Compared to other role-playing games, EARS:

* is more fun for people who aren't super into games or role-playing

* gets started faster

* involves less math and fewer rules

* tells wilder stories

* gives the players more control over the action

* leans even more on the gamemaster's ability to improvise

EARS isn't a detailed simulation of combat or anything else.
It's not for you if you're a stickler for realism,
or if you're a gamemaster with a specific story to tell
and you want full control over the narrative.

EARS is something else, something unique.


## How to play

So you're ready to start a new game of EARS with some friends,
with yourself as the gamemaster.
Here's how to begin.

Use a few sentences to set the scene.

> *(text set off like this is dialog for a cartoon)*
>
> GM: Around sunset you come to the mouth of Cagnoor Cave.
> It's twilight, and the cave is in a pine forest not far outside town.
> You've been hired by a local aristocrat
> to capture a small lizard that is rumored to live deep in this cave.
> And you've brought everything you need with you,
> including a fancy lizard cage that the aristocrat designed himself.

*FIXME: Change this example to provide an immediate opportunity for action.*

That's more than enough. No need to go on all day.

EARS isn't about you.

Now the players will take turns deciding what they want to do in the story.
Suppose the first player says:

> P1: I turn on my flashlight and go into the cave.

*FIXME: P1 needs to immediately try something risky enough to make an interesting 1-6 spread.*

That seems simple enough.
But in EARS, nothing is certain!

Once a player has decided what to do,
they roll the die to see how their action turned out.
The GM decides what happens.

> P1: (rolls a 3)
>
> GM: OK. The cave is big enough that you can walk in without crouching.
> It's damp, and the ground is flat, angled slightly downward.
> There's graffiti here, from kids goofing around. Nothing surprising.
> A little bit ahead, the passage goes around a corner, out of sight.
