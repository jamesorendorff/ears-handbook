# Game Show

2018 January 27

A very quick experiment to see how well a hard clock works in EARS.
Unsurprisingly it works very well.

For this quick pick-up game with my kids,
the three players grabbed premade characters.
As it turned out their characters' traits and abilities mattered not in the slightest.

The PCs were on a sound stage for a Japanese game show.
I asked for their team name. They said they were the Robots.
I said the opposing team was the Anti-Robots.


## Act I

In the first act, the players went into a tiny one-room house "packed
with all the things that are in our house" and were assigned the job of
finding and disarming three confetti bombs (large boxes covered with
colorful wrapping paper). The host rapidly explained that to disarm the
bombs they had to swap the red and blue wires, put the green wire where
the yellow-wire-was-then-cut-the-orange-and-brown-wires-and-OK start the
clock! Let's go!

The players had to find the bombs first. They tried things like "I look
in the kitchen cabinets" and "I look under everything in the house". On
a middling roll, they would find a clue on construction paper pointing
them toward some other hiding place. On a low roll, well, everything in
the house was booby-trapped to make a giant mess; whenever they opened a
cabinet or anything else, all our junk poured out; they got covered in
honey and confetti, and sprayed with water, and they eventually found an
Anti-Robots team member with a fire extinguisher, who sprayed foam
everywhere.

**Rule: Think fast.** Initially they had something like 47 seconds on the clock,
and I counted down only while a player was sitting there trying to decide what to do,
holding up the game.
This wasn't as annoying to the players as I thought it would be.
I played it very soft, counting down only a few seconds at a time
before shutting up to let them think.

When the clock reached 20 seconds, the house slowly began to rotate like
a Ferris wheel until it was upside down.

The players blew up two bombs and defused the last with 7 seconds left on the clock.


## Act II

The players were then put into a clean, tidy new one-room house exactly
like the first. Now their job was to hide three confetti bombs and booby-trap the house.
This they did; when it looked like they might be running out of ideas I had the
game show host hand them a roll of invisible wire.
I tried to remember the numbers they rolled on each attempt to hide something or set a trap.

Time ran out.
The show staff came in to hide clues.
One of the players was chosen to stay in the house;
she chose as her weapon a blow-gun full of glitter.

Then it was the Anti-Robots' turn.

**Rule: Your turn to watch.**
Now the players took a break from normal EARS action.
I rolled a die for the Anti-Robots as they tried to find each of the hidden bombs
and sidestep each of the traps the team had laid,
and compared these rolls with the team's earlier rolls
(with the PCs getting reasonable boosts for ingenuity).
I went through this quickly, with a roll for each thing the PCs had done,
rather than treating it as though the Anti-Robots were playing a game of EARS.

It was fun!
Poor Team Anti-Robots rolled badly and managed to trigger almost every trap
and blow up all three of the confetti bombs,
so the Robots won a million yen for the charity of their choice.


## Lessons

A heart-pounding good time. The kids enjoyed it, and it wrapped in under an hour.
If I had this to do over, I would have the PCs be playing for a charity of *my* choice,
a puppy shelter or orphanage;
and the Anti-Robots would be playing for an evil charity.

I might also swap the order of the two acts. But it went really well this way.

I definitely would have written down the numbers on the clock as they counted down;
several times I forgot how much time was left.
