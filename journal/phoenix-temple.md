# Temple of the Phoenix

Two players.

Before I ran this game, I jotted down some notes.

> What is in this jungle temple?
> * skeletons
> * tiger skeletons
> * arrow traps / spike trap / cave-in trap / a mimic
> * giant snake
> * invisible spearmen
> * phoenix
> * gold
> * chambers choked with vines
> * a stone ladder
> * low stone ceilings
>
> What equipment will the PCs get?
> * flint and tinder
> * machete
> * pistol?
> * pipe and tobacco
> * monocle

And I used pretty much all of this. The temple was designed to force the
players forward to the final chamber, where they ignited a phoenix's
pyre, bringing it back to life.
Because the action was on rails, there were few
opportunities for player cleverness. Nothing mattered.

I used combat with "damage points" that counted up, without telling the
players how much damage they could take before dying. This went badly.
But injury drawbacks are not fun in any game.

I had the *players* roll damage when their characters *took* damage.
This was weird and felt very bad, especially when they rolled sixes.

The monsters did not have any apparent personality or motivation. It
wasn't fun.

I mercy-saved a PC from absolutely certain death, which also felt bad.

On the whole, a pretty big whiff.
