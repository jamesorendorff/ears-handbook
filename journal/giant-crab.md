# Giant Crab

M. ran a game. She's 7, almost 8.

J. played Luther Backsmack, a brilliant sausage vendor but terrible
salesman, with a grill, cooler of sausages and onions, and trench coat.

T. played Dudins, who had a hangglider, 60ft of rope, a pocket knife,
and a water bottle full of compressed air that could be used as a sort
of rocket.

A. played Harper, a mildly immortal person who's been alive since the
Middle Ages, and has a grappling hook gun and a hamster she can ride.

I wrote: "Venkat is a gorilla who is a professor of biology. He is
persuasive, quick, and good with animals. He also has a YouTube channel
with 1 million subscribers. No one minds that he doesn't wear pants."
Then I proceeded to roll a 1 on "gorilla" and "no one minds".

We were travelers, and we arrived during a town meeting about how to
appease the giant crab. We prepared a luau for the crab and were going
to offer sausages as a sacrifice to it. The players wouldn't stay at the
table and things grew tedious.


My notes for M. as GM:

-   **It's your job as GM to say whose turn it is.** - NEW - In a way
    this is your most important job. EARS is fun when things are
    happening, and the most fun on your turn. it must not get bogged
    down.

-   **Drive the action forward.** We were waiting for a giant crab to
    arrive and attack the village. It kept not arriving, so some of us
    struggled to find anything to do.

-   **Keep the players together.** - NEW - The PCs tend to split and
    scatter in EARS. In this game, we were all travelers; Luther decided
    to continue on his journey and went to his grandmother's
    house. M. made it so the grandma happened to know the giant crab
    doesn't like sausages, compelling Luther to return and deliver the
    bad news before it was too late. Perfect: let the PCs split up, but
    give them in-game excuses to gather back together.

-   **End it.** M. did a great job ending it once it became tedious,
    even though this meant cutting the story short. Merciful!

-   **Choose quickly.** Like every starting GM, M. suffered occasional
    paralysis. Unfortunately EARS has an inherent flaw where if the GM
    thinks for 4.7 seconds about how to handle a roll, the players
    happily fill the silence with unwanted suggestions.
    
    One question is: Is DM-ing quickly a matter of practice? If so, can
    we help by including "exercises" in the EARS book?

I also had to explain to M. that the meaning of a roll is not just "1-3
fail, 4-6 succeed". It depends on if the player is asking for something
reasonable.

-   "I have a portable grill" should succeed on a 2+. It's a super
    reasonable request. Anyone who's ever had five bucks and dropped by
    a garage sale might have one.

    And even if the player rolls a 1 for this, there's no need to
    *punish* them. A failure doesn't have to be punishing, particularly
    in character generation! You can give the player a portable *drill*
    instead, or say they own a barbecue restaurant (grill yes, portable
    no).

-   "I have a Ph.D. in Anthropology" is a more daring request, as this
    is something that takes many years of effort. Still, as the DM you
    want to encourage people to ask for this sort of thing! It should
    probably succeed on a 3+. On a 2, maybe your degree is from the
    School of Hard Knocks. On a 1, maybe you're a dumpster diver (note:
    maybe the player will be sad at first, but this functions as a
    superpower in EARS).

-   "I have a dragon" is an unwanted level of request. Any number less
    than a 6 should be punished: the player thinks they're a dragon; or
    (in a nonmagical world) the player has a phobia of reptiles; or (on
    a 1) the player has a powerful ancient dragon as an enemy.

    On a 6, they must indeed "have" a dragon. Be scrupulously respectful
    of the player's right to full success: you might decide they have a
    right to expect a magical, flying, firebreathing creature that can
    fight at their side, but that they can't reasonably expect to ride
    or control it (since they didn't ask for that).

The point should also be made that during character generation in
particular, but also in gameplay, very often you just want to write a
check mark or "very!!" or "nope" and move on.
