# Beach Pirates

2 characters:

* Eli: minotaur athlete with assorted weapons

* Sam: game-breaker attempt; also, rolled 6 on ability to shapeshift into anything at will

Most pirates have gone online, but there is still one band of outlaws that land in motorboats, with automatic weapons and prosthetic chainsaw limbs, to raid and pillage the mainland.

Eli's minotaur had an incredibly heroic sequence where he hid behind an ice cream stand; dashed through a hail of bullets to steal a pirate's landing boat; got onto the main ship; managed to cut the cables so the other landing boats couldn't be brought back aboard; eluded the pirates on the ship; jumped off the deck onto a heavy gun sticking out the side of the ship and entered through there. 

J's comment: **Close combat doesn't work well; what do I do if the player is pinned down? no HP or AC.**

The complaint is that there was no good "out" when Eli finally got cornered and rolled a 1. I think this is a GM failure that can't be fully fixed with rules changes. We can provide guidance in the book:

* Combat should probably be d6-vs-d6 contests? But maybe that doesn't affect this situation.

* The book should say, "Don't be afraid to disarm your PC and give them a mortal wound."

* The book should also give a list of good consequences for losing in combat, from light to solid to severe. This is important, EARS-specific, and fun; the GM can read it once and have it in their back pocket forever.

J stumbled as GM (in my view) on a key roll: after all the above adventures, Eli attempted to pull the pin on a grenade, toss it in the magazine, and abandon ship. He rolled 2. To me, the move is obvious: he pulls the pin, drops the grenade, then a pirate appears blocking his exit. J was more impish, and had Eli complete the action--but mistaking a smoke grenade for a regular one.

Then Sam turned into a kraken, rolled two 6's and sank all the ships. (J's comment: **Handbook needs suggestions for drawbacks when failing powerful abilities during character creation.**)
