## Introduction

**What is EARS?**
EARS is a role-playing system based on the idea that any player should be allowed to try anything.
The gameplay is fresh, fun, and chaotic.
There are endless opportunities for players to be clever and creative.
No one sits back and gets left out.

**What isn’t EARS?**
EARS is not a detailed simulation.
There are no statistics and no tables.
There aren't books full of rules to learn or extra equipment to buy.
You can get a game started, even with new players, in just minutes.
All you really need is a six-sided die.

**How does it work?**
Whenever it’s your turn, you simply say what you want to do and roll a die.
Rolling a six (6) means you succeed perfectly, regardless of how impossible or insane your action is.
Rolling a one (1) means you fail, regardless of how easy or mundane your goal was.
The gamemaster is required to reward or punish the player’s true intent if a six or a one is rolled respectively.
The story will take whatever twists occur due to the outcomes.

**But… won’t the players just do whatever they want?**
Possibly!

**But… that doesn’t sound like a game?!!**
Oh but it is!
And there are dynamics built into the game that
help keep things *just* this side of bonkers for up to an hour!
For example, players have to be at least a little careful about risks.
While rolling a six can deliver the impossible, anything less does not.
The gamemaster interprets rolls from two to five according to how likely the action was to succeed,
and what failure is likely to entail.
A player can try to fight a giant by main strength, and in EARS they might get lucky!
But they have every reason to try to find another way.
When the players *do* run rampant, a calm gamemaster gets to tap the brakes
roughly five turns out of six.
Players quickly find that what works best is stretching the bounds of reality only a little bit,
and saving the wildest ideas for when they’ve run out of easy options.


## Quick Play Rules

Give it a shot! Here’s how an EARS adventure gets started:

**Gather ’round.**
Find some friends and at least one six-sided die. You might also want paper and pens.

**Pick someone to be the gamemaster.**
(Although, if you’re reading this, I guess that’s probably you.)

**Create a quick story idea.**
Your gamemaster takes a moment to think of a starting scene and a challenge the players might be tempted to tackle.
E.g. It might be a book or movie plot, or it could be a twisted idea of your own invention.


**Create some characters.**
Take a moment to help each player make up a character to play.
These don’t have to follow any main rules (For character building tips, see page ###.)
It might help to jot down the characters' names and a word or two about them before you start playing.
Nobody's memory is perfect.

**Open the game.**
The gamemaster starts by setting the scene with a few sentences.
It doesn't take much and can go in any direction you want.
Some examples are below.

*   Classic Adventure:
    “You're all standing at the mouth of a mountain cave.
    You're pretty sure this is where the dragon took the mayor's daughter.”

*   Minimalist
    “It’s dark here.”

*   Avant Garde
    “Lo, it is the three thousandth year of the great Smirking,
    and as the sunsets pile up on the horizon you are called forth from the hairiest armpits of the earth
    to be ritually mocked and humiliated once again.”

**Play starts.** The players take turns, the GM asking each player what they will do:

Each turn, a player declares what their character will attempt. The character can attempt anything.
The gamemaster will advise if something is very risky, but ultimately the player is free to try anything.

The player rolls a six-sided die and the gamemaster describes the result as he invents it.
Any 6 rolled is a success. Any 1 rolled is a failure.
The results for a roll in-between depends on how risky or easy the action was.

After each player goes, sometimes the gamemaster will decide
another fictional character needs to try an action to help or thwart the players.
The gamemaster typically makes the rolls for those non-player characters (NPCs) in secret.

**That’s it!**
You’ve got enough information to play EARS, or at least enough to experiment.
The rest of this guide includes recommendations to make the game run better
and keep it fun for everyone.

Gamemaster Tips

    Cartoon: 16 frames, GM in the lower left of each frame, different players
    yelling out what they want to do

    i go into the cave
    i make the jump to light speed!
    i try to disarm him. it. the thing
    i use the high chair and the broom as improvised weapons

    i deny my family and renounce my name
    hmm... i'll taste it--i guess...
    i dive in the lake after it!
    i kiss her

    well i hit him back!
    i search the whole house
    i run away
    i look in the hatch

    i sit tight (another player yells "but that's madness!")
    moving very carefully, i steal his helmet
    i order the men to tie me to the mast
    i try again

----

Once that's all sorted out, the player rolls a six-sided die.  Then the
gamemaster tells how the action played out.  The higher the die roll, the more
likely the attempt is to succeed.  If the player rolls a 6, the action
 succeeds.  If the player rolls a 1, it fails, at least a little.  In between,
it is up to the gamemaster's judgement whether, and to what degree, the attempt
succeeds.  A simple, everyday action, like running to catch a bus or digging a
hole, has a low threshold to meet; the character might manage with a 5, 4, 3,
or even a 2.  An overreaching or risky action may fail whether the player rolls
a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  But gamemasters note again: true success on a 6, in the
spirit of the chosen action, without snarky literal-mindedness or backhanded
results, is the player's right.

*(TODO: graph with easy, medium, and hard actions)*

Here's one example worked all the way out. Of course you could say
anything you want in response to this action. These are just examples.

    Cartoon: Six panels could illustrate what happens when a simple attempt
    meets with a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

    P1: wait, so the whole room is lit only by the birthday cake?
    GM: yeah
    P1: i swing down on the rope and knock over the cake, so all the candles go out
    GM: hah! ok, roll

    (large "{" symbol)

    1 - just as you leap you notice that the rope is too long!
        you go splat on the floor. everyone stares.
        the queen's guards step forward, spears at the ready.
        
        *(note: failure, exciting consequences)*

    2 - as you swing down from the rafters,
        the queen mum instinctively backs up a few steps,
        still holding the cake.
        clinging to the rope, you sail helplessly by, the cake just out of reach.
        you land awkwardly by the window. everyone stares at you.

        *(note: failure, funny consequences)*

    3 - your aim is perfect! well, almost. your body merges with the cake.
        the room goes dark. but then you go splat into something
        very tall and very unamused.
        P1: uh oh
        GM: judging by touch, uh, and sound, and smell, it's the queen's honor guard!

        *(note: qualified success, exciting consequences)*

    4 - your aim is perfect! well, almost. there's a huge "splat",
        the candles go out, the room goes dark, but
        now you're covered with cake and icing!
        and--weren't there a couple guards in here somewhere?!

        *(note: success, exciting consequences)*

    5 - ok, you swing down and manage to knock over the cake.
        it's dark. in the chaos you manage to land on your feet
        and get your back to a wall.

        *(note: solid success)*

    6 - you swing down, and knock over the cake!
        the room goes dark!
        do you want to swing back up to the rafters?
        P1: sure
        GM: ok, you're back in the rafters. with a slice of the cake on a plate!
            it's strawberry lemon!
        P1: my favorite!

        *(note: total success, cake bonus for heroic action)*

In this game, the player's chosen act was exactly the kind of heroic
trouble-making the GM wants the player to make. So while some rolls
succeed, and others fail, *none of the outcomes are punitive*.

Success can be fun.
Failure can be fun.
Either success or failure can bring trouble.
Trouble can be fun.

    XXX TODO

----

The gamemaster gets a turn too.  On the gamemaster's turn, any non-player
characters and unpredictable inanimate objects in the story get to attempt
actions of their own.  The GM does not have to announce what they're trying to
do, only what the player characters observe.

    P1: oh, is it my turn?
    GM: no, wait, i have to roll for something
    (rolls in secret)
    GM: ok, so, nothing unusual happens this turn.
    P2: well that's a relief
    P1: "this turn"?

----

If a player character is killed or otherwise removed from the action of the
story, that player sits out the next two rounds.  Then the GM can give him or
her another character to play.  (Or, it can turn out that the character wasn't
really dead and has miraculously recovered—but that isn't always plausible!)

    P3: geez, would you make up your mind already
    P2: all right... all right all right, here's what i want to do. dodging the
        falling rocks, i rescue the idol from the pedestal and run back out the
        tunnel.
    (pause)
    P1: huh huh huh
    GM: seriously.
    P2: that's what i want to do.
    P3: what could go wrong?
    GM: ok, roll it
    (2)
    GM: um.
    GM: well ok, you, uh, you are smashed flat by a boulder the size of a
        house, and then you're buried under millions of tons of rock.
    P2: man, i almost had it

----

The game ends when the story does. Or when the players are done with it. Usually both.

End on a high point.
Don’t worry about tying off every loose end.

    Clock: 12:45 AM
    GM: and the giant tumbles to the ground, dead!
    P1: woot!
    P2: that's how it's done dog.

    P3: i search his pockets!
    (2)
    GM: um, you search one pocket and you find, um, a gigantic comb.  i guess

    P1: i search his other pocket
    (6)
    GM: wow ok, you find the missing elf princess!  she was in his pocket all along
    P1: that's so sweet
    P2: i marry her
    P1: ha ha
    GM: heh, roll
    (2)
    P1: oh, that's not going to do it

    GM: she tells you, um, no, she gives you a friendly wink and tells you she's already been married for 500 years
    P1: that line again :(
    GM: yeah
    P3: is it my turn yet?

    GM: sure
    P3: i live happily ever after!
    (1)
    P1: ha ha
    P2: oh that sucks
    GM: heh, well, you get kidnapped by traveling carnival folk and put into a freak show.

    P3: what? my guy is not a freak!
    GM: well, they have to work on you to make you into a freak.  anyway, you end up traveling all over the world but you are miserable, because you get seasick too easily.

    P1: ha ha, ok, i want to live happily ever after too
    (4)
    GM: hmmmm. you settle down with a burly lumberjack--
    P1: ha ha
    P2: heh
    GM: --and together you are poor but very happy.

    P2: ok, i don't want to live happily ever after, i want to be a traveling hero
    (6)
    P3: oh that's awesome

    GM: heh, do i even have to say anything about that?
    P2: yeah dude! that's your job
    GM: ok then.

    (pause)

    GM: as the others go back to their, uh, lives--
    P3: as the carnival people roll away...
    P1: ha ha ha
    GM: --a cloud passes over the sun, and for a moment you feel a premonition
        of what is to come. it will be a dark time in the land these coming
        years. there will be monsters and evil magic and famine and
        war. everywhere people will be helpless and hopeless. but also you see
        that something will sustain them: the courage, and the strength, and
        the fighting spirit, of a hero. then the cloud passes. you sheathe your
        sword, throw the haversack over your shoulder, and set off on the high
        road out of town to the west.
    ~fin~

Choosing the right stopping point, and making it stick,
can have a surprising impact on how much the players enjoy the game.
Understandably, some players don’t want to quit while they’re still having fun.
Others (particularly folks who like EARS because they enjoy *pure chaos*)
may not want to quit until the game is well and truly blown up.
As GM, the stopping point is the one thing you really do control in EARS.
No one can make you keep going.

*(I wonder if it can help to just be super clear with your players when the game is winding down:
“wow! that was great, you did it—now we’re in the epilogue/denouement, everyone take one more turn...”)*


## Making characters

All a character really needs is a name and a personality that's worth playing.
The character's appearance, job, skills, and possessions are gravy.

Here are three ways to invent fun personalities for a game.

----

One fast way to make characters is to pick a few descriptive words that speak
to your character's personality.  The language is full of rich, evocative words
for talking about people.  Pick a few that will affect how your character
behaves. Will you be relentless and cruel? Wiry, talkative, rash, and panicky?
Buff and confident but hot-tempered? Passionate, indomitable, and fat?

The GM should write down all the character notes, vetoing the ones that seem too disruptive.
*(I don't know why I put the word “veto” in here; no one word is more opposed to the spirit of the game)*

    P1: so anything at all?
    P2: yeah
    GM: within reason
    P1: i can be a boy-crazy barista?

    GM: (writing it down) that works. you need a name
    P1: zoe. no chloe.
    P3: how about phloe?
    P1: no, definitely chloe.

    P2: ok, it's my turn right?
    GM: yeah
    P2: i'll be a pedantic power-walker
    P1: awesome
    P2: named joel, and can i be prudish too?
    GM: (writing) sure, sounds good

    P3: i want to be a telepathic turtle
    GM: ...come on
    P1: don't we all
    P2: stop being a dick!

    P3: all right all right then i'll be--hey, alliteration is optional, right?
    GM: totally optional
    P3: i want to be a melodramatic librarian with delusions of grandeur

    GM: great. (writes)
    P1: it's no fun if you just play yourself
    P3: hey, i am *not* a librarian

    GM: need a name
    P3: Emperor Octavius Maximus Excessivus Robusto...
    GM: (writing) max.
    P3: all right, The Man, i can be max.

    GM: ok. you're all at the bus stop one monday morning when suddenly...

### Characters in 25 words or less

TODO

### Just so characters

(pregenerated)

**Start the characters.**
The gamemaster thinks of a short character description sentence and writes it down on a clean sheet of paper.
E.g. “Hilda is a working mother of four with a knack for tennis.”
Make one character sheet per player.

**Pick your favorite character.**
The gamemaster reveals the sentences and each player picks which one they’d like to start with.
Whenever more than one player picks the same favorite, roll a die to decide.

**Add to your character.**
Each player spends a few minutes thinking of two additional short sentences to describe their character
and two items the character might keep with them.
Write those down. E.g. “Hilda studied kung fu with Shaolin masters.
She is on the run from the law after hacking a government computer.
Items: A secret exploding tennis ball and a phone.”

**Roll the characters and adjust.**
Each player in turn reads their sentences and items aloud,
rolling a six-sided die for each sentence and item.
Your character only keeps that sentence if you are successful on your roll.
Remember, rolling a six always honors the player’s intent and rolling a one is always opposite to their intent--
all other results are scaled by the likelihood of the sentence.
Based on your roll, you either keep the sentence as it stands or the gamemaster provides a new sentence.



## Part 2 - Gamemaster tips

### Guidelines

**Keep it short.**
Playing EARS is creatively exhausting, and its brand of relentlessly wacky fun can start to grate after a while.

**Keep it light.**
EARS does unexpected things almost every round.
It’s a rough game on characters.

**Skip the parts nobody wants.**
You could make the players roll to get out of bed in the morning, get dressed, go downstairs, and leave the inn.
But if you do, EARS is going to turn that into an adventure.
It will take 45 minutes to get everybody out on the street,
and when they get there half of them will be covered in toxic goo for some reason.

If the adventure really starts at the abandoned mine, just say,
“The next morning, you all go to the abandoned mine,” and pick up from there.

### Balance (or, what makes EARS tick)

- moving on

### Keeping it light

### Mundane tasks

As in life, sometimes in EARS the simplest things can be frustrating.

> P1: I look for aluminum foil in the grocery store.
> *(rolls a 2)*
>
> GM: Oh dear.

Remember, *a 2 is not necessarily a failure.*
Human beings are resourceful,
and grocery stores are designed to help us succeed.
Anyone can find foil in a store five times out of six.
If we needed good luck to find the basics, we would all have starved by now.
Or, our leftovers would have gone bad.
Or whatever happens when there's no foil.

> GM: Wellll, all right, after some wandering around,
> you manage to find the foil.
>
> P1: Phew.

This is fine as long as the player is having fun.

But sometimes the other players have spent their turns
succesfully wrestling dinosaurs and saving small galaxies,
and this one player who needs aluminum foil just can't catch a break.

Now, maybe they *should* have said,
"I run into the grocery store, open a roll of aluminum foil, rip off a square, and run out again."
If they had tried *that* and rolled a 2, how great would that be?
You could have had them succeed,
but an outraged customer chases them out of the store.
This guy is a genuine mensch. He was a cornerback in high school.
Just a beautiful development.



> *(the next turn)*
>
> P1: All right. I'm going to use the self-checkout.
> *(rolls a 1)*
>
> GM: *(gesture of despair)*




### Making failure fun
A good game is fun to lose. ...

- multiple kinds of failure
- not getting all the way there is a nice mild kind of failure
  (but don't force them to retry the same action next turn)
- a failure doesn't have to introduce new problems, but that is often hilarious

### Handling frustration

### Handling silly attempts (“I turn into a dragon!”)

### Handling overreaching (“I destroy the ring!”)



### Death

### Things we have tried that don't work

### Other misc. junk to include

- why it's important to take turns
- how much does power balance really matter?
- why EARS isn't broken: you were really trying to have fun together all along

- extra rules for extra situations
  - 

- the challenges of GMing EARS
  - deciding what happens
    - some rolls are easy: rolling a 5 on attacking the robot with a baseball bat,
      well, that's pretty much going to be a nice solid hit.
    - other times it's hard to think of anything!
      i spent a lot of my first EARS game going uhhh.. uhhh...
    - don't worry too much about this, the experience is not as bad as you think
    - but of course, it's more important to decide something than to come up with the perfect answer
    - Players love suggesting things, out of sheer glee.
      It's up to you whether to take these, but careful—they often aren't fair.
    - fluency (players having easy decisions) depends on having multiple things going on, but not too much


  - not being boring
  - when the party splits up
    - this happens all the time, because you can and because it's so hard to act in concert.
    - usually isn't a problem, actually!
    - but give scattered PCs an excuse to get back together--it's better for the story for threads to converge

- perils of GMing EARS
  - the player who wants to smash the game wide open by wishing for wishes or whatever
  - the team just took 10 minutes to destroy the One Ring, now what



## Planned experiments

- mattie wants me to watch black mirror bandersnatch "PLEASE" - DONE

- Play the same scenario 3 times. 

- How about a save-restore mechanism?



### Gwarkleball

This is a major sport, designed to offer lots of chances for player cleverness.

thwonkers ride go-karts or giraffes and carry super long mallets;
teams may modify the playing field for 24 hours prior to play;
objects called "keys" are required to pass various lines;
penalties in the form of heavy bags of sand which must be carried,
or the release of wild animals within one's territory;
flags indicate control of regions;
contests and goal-scoring flips control of regions.


## Open research questions

-   On a 6, can the action succeed, but not quite bring about the
    desired result, because (due to GM “cheating”) it turns out to have
    been the wrong thing to do? Is that really cheating?

-   Can EARS sustain a campaign?

-   What character development stuff might work? (J. proposes a "reroll
    a die" thing.)

-   Is it possible to plan anything as the GM?

-   Can it be less crazy? Is it still EARS if the players agree in
    advance to any gameworld limits at all?

-   Do those additional character generation ideas I put in really
    work/matter? Why not offer “play yourself” as the first option? Are
    personality traits really important/fun at all? I mean, the fact is,
    most people just want to play themselves, or movie characters, the
    first ten to fifty RPG characters they make. If your players are
    experienced role-players or improv actors and they want to create a
    fresh character, you don’t have to force them to do it. So maybe the
    right character generation mechanic for newbs is: pick a fictional
    character, a celebrity, or yourself—and just be that person.

-   Might a campaign setting generation table, a menu of elements, be
    fun?

-   What about a list of PC curses (for low rolls on character
    generation)? (would probably only worsen paralysis)

-   A list of "time bombs" and other narrative/gameplay gimmicks?
